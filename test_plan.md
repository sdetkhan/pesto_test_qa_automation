# Test Deliverables:
The following test deliverables will be produced during the testing process:
- Test Strategy Document
- Test Plan (this document)
- Test Cases: Comprehensive test cases for functional, usability, performance, security, compatibility, regression, accessibility, and acceptance testing.
- Test Data: Data sets for testing various scenarios, including user accounts, products, and orders.
- Defect Reports: Documenting all identified issues, including their severity and status.
- Test Summary Report: A final report summarizing the test results and overall quality of the website.

# Test Schedule:
The testing schedule is divided into phases and will be conducted as follows:
- Unit Testing: Performed by developers during the development phase.
- Integration Testing: Scheduled to start immediately after unit testing, estimated to take two weeks.
- System Testing: To follow integration testing and last for three weeks.
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT): Planned to start after successful system testing, with an estimated duration of two weeks.

# Test Resources:
The following resources will be required for testing:
- Testing Team: Comprising testers, test leads, and a test manager.
- Development Team: To assist with defect resolution.
- Test Environment: A dedicated test server, supported browsers, mobile devices, and network emulation tools.
- Test Data: A set of data including test user accounts, product data, and sample orders.
- Test Tools: Selenium, Jira, TestRail, Apache JMeter, OWASP ZAP, aXe, and various emulators and simulators.
- Stakeholder Involvement: Business analysts, product owners, and end-users for UAT.

# Test Data and Environment Setup:
- Test Data: Test data will be generated for various scenarios, including user accounts, products, and orders. Production data will not be used in testing.
- Test Environment Setup: A dedicated testing server will replicate the production environment. Browsers and devices for compatibility testing will be acquired. Network emulation tools will simulate different network conditions.

# Test Execution and Reporting:
- Test Execution: Testers will execute test cases, record the results, and report defects. Testing will proceed through the defined phases: unit, integration, system, and UAT.
- Defect Management: Defects will be logged in Jira, including details such as severity, status, and steps to reproduce. Developers will fix and retest defects as necessary.
- Test Progress Reporting: Daily stand-up meetings will be conducted to review testing progress and address any roadblocks. Test lead and test manager will provide regular status updates to the project team.
- Test Summary Reporting: After completing all testing phases, a Test Summary Report will be created. This report will include test results, defect statistics, and an assessment of the website's overall quality.

By following this detailed test plan, we aim to ensure thorough testing of the e-commerce website, identify and resolve defects, and provide stakeholders with a clear picture of the website's quality and readiness for production.
